# Internship-Project-2

This full-stack web project was developed during my internship at Turkcell, in the Fixed Campaign Solutions department, together with my teammate Alican Çopur. It integrates with the department’s database to support data management and testing operations. The application also features interactive charts for data visualization, a secure authentication page, and personalized user profile sections.
